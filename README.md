Geojson is a data format which encodes a geographic entities like area, route, river etc. and has format as given below:
```
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [125.6, 10.1]
  },
  "properties": {
    "name": "Dinagat Islands"
  }
}
```

## Prepping the data
Finding Geojson format for Indian districts turned out to be a daunting task. So
Geojson format was generated by converting shape files available at http://www.gadm.org/country
using this tool: https://ogre.adc4gis.com/

Just upload the zip file downloaded fron GADM into Ogre and save the result in a .json file.

## Stack used in this project
* jquery and fontawesome
* typescript and sass
* expressjs
* elasticsearch

please note that to render the above shape onto the map ts, sass, elasticsearch and expressjs
are unnecessary and can be achieved by simple frontend javascript. The other technologies
are used for experimentation purpose only.

## Setting up the project

### Git clone
``` git clone https://github.com/anna93/google-maps-overlay.git ```

### Install npm modules
``` npm install ```

### Install bower modules
``` bower install ```

### Index the included Geojson into elasticsearch
``` node elasticindexer.js ```

### Run
``` node app.js ```

or if in developmemt mode:

``` nodemon app.js ```

You will need to run gulp for auto compilation of ts and sass, use:

``` gulp ass:ts:watch ```
